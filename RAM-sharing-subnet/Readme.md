# Instructions
nothing is easier if you don't remember the right procedure :)

* choose a subnet in a vpc (default vpc subnet cannot be shared)
* choose a destination account
* login in this account with another profile
* go in RAM (don't do it from the subnet itself because you need to add the subnet id anyway and this can be confusing)
* Create a resource share
* give it a name, select subnet, select the id , click next 2 times
* display organization structure, select the account and click next
* go in the destination account RAM and shared with me
* click on the subnet you can see in the vpc
